# Sarah - I like to decorate cakes when I get the chance and I made my first wedding cake for my sisterâ€™s wedding when I was 14 years old. I grew up with dogs my whole life and I just love dogs so much, they are the best! I have never eaten meat beforeâ€¦that I know ofðŸ˜¶

# Jeremy - I like to make little video games (just text based adventures, nothing impressive). Other than that I just spend a lot of time reading. I have two pets: a bearded dragon and a cat. I am looking into getting a dog soon though!
